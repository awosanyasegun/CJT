var task = ["take out Garbage ","Read a book ","write Javascript code ", "Go to work "];
 var progress = ["done","in progress", "to do"];
 var question1 = prompt("which task 1-4");
 var question2 = prompt("status 1 = done 2 = in progress 3 = todo?");
 
 console.log("today you will " + task[question1-1] + "status of task = " + progress[question2-1]);
